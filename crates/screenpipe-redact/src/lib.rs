//! Async PII redaction reconciliation for screenpipe.
//!
//! ## Why this crate exists
//!
//! Screenpipe captures OCR text, accessibility-tree text, audio
//! transcripts, and clipboard contents. Some of that text is PII the
//! user does not want to forward to a remote LLM, share via a pipe,
//! or surface in cross-app search.
//!
//! Inline redaction would tax the capture hot path (200-500 ms / row,
//! stalls when a remote provider is unreachable). This crate runs the
//! redactor as a **background reconciliation worker** instead — same
//! shape as the FTS / migration backfill workers already in the repo.
//! Capture stays fast; redaction trails behind by a configurable
//! polling interval.
//!
//! See [issue #3185](https://github.com/screenpipe/screenpipe/issues/3185)
//! for the full design.
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! Two parallel modalities — text and image — sharing infra (error
//! type, [`SpanLabel`] taxonomy, worker shape) but with separate
//! inference paths so neither modality's hot-path latency budget
//! bleeds into the other.
//!
//! ### Text
//!
//! - [`Redactor`] — text trait. Batch of strings → redacted strings.
//! - [`adapters::regex`] — deterministic, on-device, free.
//!   Emails / cards / phones / connection strings / common API-key
//!   shapes / private-key block markers. Always runs first.
//! - [`adapters::tinfoil`] — HTTP client for the Tinfoil-hosted
//!   confidential-compute enclave. Used today by the search-time
//!   filter; moved here so the reconciliation worker and the
//!   search-time path share one implementation.
//! - [`adapters::onnx`] (feature-gated) — local ONNX-runtime
//!   inference of the text PII redactor. CoreML on Mac, DirectML on
//!   Windows. **No CUDA / Vulkan / GPU-vendor SDKs bundled.**
//! - [`pipeline`] — regex pre-pass plus AI fallback for residual
//!   text. Hash-cached per-string so repeated UI chrome is free on
//!   the second pass.
//! - [`worker`] — text reconciliation loop. Polls the DB for
//!   un-redacted rows on the four text-bearing tables (`ocr_text`,
//!   `audio_transcriptions`, `accessibility`, `ui_events`).
//!
//! ### Image
//!
//! - [`ImageRedactor`] — image trait. JPG path → pixel-space bboxes.
//!   Same canonical [`SpanLabel`] enum the text path uses.
//! - [`adapters::rfdetr`] (feature-gated) — RF-DETR-Nano image PII
//!   detector. Same EP chain as `adapters::onnx`.
//! - [`image::frame_redactor`] — applies detected regions to a JPG.
//!   Solid black (NOT blur — blur is reversible). Pure pixel pushing,
//!   no model.
//! - [`image::worker`] — image reconciliation loop. Scans the
//!   `frames` table, calls `ImageRedactor::detect` +
//!   `frame_redactor::redact_frame`, atomically overwrites the source
//!   JPG, and stamps `frames.image_redacted_at` (the single
//!   "is processed" gate after the 20260507 drop-duplicates migration).
//!
//! ## Defaults
//!
//! Off. Users opt in via Settings → Privacy. See worker docs for the
//! full set of knobs.
