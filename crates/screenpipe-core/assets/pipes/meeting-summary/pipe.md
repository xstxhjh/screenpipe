a meeting just ended. find it, summarize it, and patch the summary back onto its record so the user sees it next time they open the meeting.

keep the wording of this prompt in sync with `buildMeetingSummarizeInstructions` in `apps/screenpipe-app-tauri/lib/utils/meeting-context.ts` (used by the in-app "summarize with AI" button) — the two surfaces should produce the same behavior.

read the screenpipe skill first so you know the meetings + search endpoints.

step 1 — find the meeting that just ended:

  curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $SCREENPIPE_API_AUTH_KEY" \
    "http://localhost:3030/meetings?limit=1"

the most recent row is the one that just ended. capture its `id`, `meeting_start`, `meeting_end`, `title`, `note`, `meeting_app`, and `attendees`.

step 2 — search screenpipe for what happened during this meeting and summarize it: key topics, decisions, action items. scope your searches to the meeting's `meeting_start`/`meeting_end` window. prefer `content_type=audio` for transcripts.

step 3 — if your summary is worth saving, append it to the meeting note (and refresh the title in the same call) via:

  curl -s -X PATCH "http://localhost:3030/meetings/<MEETING_ID>" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $SCREENPIPE_API_AUTH_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"title": "<NEW_TITLE_OR_OMIT>", "note": "<EXISTING_NOTE>\n\n## Summary\n<YOUR_SUMMARY>"}'

replace `<EXISTING_NOTE>` with the meeting's current `note` field (empty string if none) so you don't overwrite the user's work; just append your summary under a `## Summary` heading. for the title: if the current title is missing, generic ("untitled", "meeting", just the app name) or doesn't capture what actually happened, replace it with a 5-8 word plain-english title (no quotes, no "meeting about…" prefix) — otherwise omit the field so a user-set title is left alone. if there's nothing useful to summarize (empty transcript, irrelevant audio), say so out loud and skip the PATCH — don't write a placeholder.
